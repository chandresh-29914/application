# 🌫️ Predicting Air Quality Levels Using Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms for Environmental Insights

## 📌 Overview

Air pollution poses a significant threat to both environmental and public health. This project aims to develop a robust machine learning pipeline to **accurately predict Air Quality Index (AQI)** using diverse environmental and meteorological datasets. Our models — including **XGBoost** and **LSTM** — are designed to provide actionable insights for public health, urban planning, and smart city initiatives.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Air quality monitoring through physical sensors is limited by high costs and sparse geographic coverage. **Machine learning** provides a scalable solution by enabling real-time AQI predictions from structured time-series data involving:

- Pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, SO₂, O₃  
- Meteorological factors: Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed  
- Location-specific attributes and timestamps
